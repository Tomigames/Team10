<h1>HELLO! This is the readme file for Phase 4 </h1>
<br>
My two use cases cases: <br>
- Create an unoffical transcript<br>
- Create, update, and delete individual assesment type, adding individual grades part<br>
<h2>Frontend</h2><br>
My frontend in simple html,css,javascript, will convert into react framework soon: <br>
- I create a sample course view page<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;- note: I created this in order to show my individual assesment type functionallity, this is assigned to someone else and not part of my use case<br>
  <h3>Individual Assesment Type</h3><br>
- Add a course: the bottom right hand corner has an add button that allows you to add a course<br>
- Delete the course: the red button allows you to delete the course<br>
- Add Section: this allows you to add an individual sections, click the blue button, such as: projects<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - this section is created as when you calculate the weighted average, you can assign it to a specific section such as projects is worth 50% and you can do that<br>
-   Add individual assigment in each section: you can click the + blue button to add the indivdual assignmnets<br>
-   Add a grade: when you add an individual grade: the average and the whole grade for the class changes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;- note: I have not done the weighted scale part, as it was not part of my use case and is handled by someone else<br>
-   Update a grade: as the individual grade is updated, the grade changes the average as well<br>
-   Delete a specific assignment: you are allowed to click the red delete button which deltes the specific assignment<br>
-   delete a section: you can delete the section as well if you would like<br>
-   edit the name of the section and the assignment: when you click on each section you may edit the name of the section and also can edit the name of the assignment and place it what ever you like.<br>
<h3>Transcript</h3><br>
- you can click the download transcript button on the right top most and it shows a pop up<br>
- you may choose a specific year and download it as per the year, or you can dowload "all" as well.<br>
- Create: this creates a downloadable pdf format<br>

<h2>Backend</h2><br>
<h3>Individual Assesment Type</h3><br>
I created a sample sql database<br>
- the database is created by someone else, i just created a sample one to test my functionalities<br>
- i created a node.js backend to calculate the assesment type- which connects to the database<br>
<h3>Transcript</h3><br>
- i created a sample backend in mysql <br>
- i performed the crud operation using the backend js format that allows me to download<br>


<h2>
  Future implmentations
</h2><br>
- connecting the front end to the backend, not every part is connected for it<br>
- attaching the mysql database made from someone else<br>
- merging my code in order to integrate everyone's code<br>
