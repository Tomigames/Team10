## Installation

Provide general installation instructions.  This project requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Frontend Setup

Instructions to set up the React.js frontend.

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will usually start the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend Setup

Instructions to set up the Node.js backend.

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Set up environment variables.  You may need to create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add necessary environment variables, such as database connection strings, API keys, etc.  See `.env.example` for a template.

4.  Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Or, if you have a development script:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The server will typically run on a specified port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
